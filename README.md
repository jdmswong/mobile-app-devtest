##Meteor / Ionic / Angular developer test

####Task: 
Complete this chat room.

####Solution details:
- When a user enters a message into the input box, a new list item will appear onscreen (for all users) with their picture, name, and the message.  
- This will be responsive and reactive, without the need to refresh the page.
- The autopublish and insecure packages must be removed.
- Deployed publicly at a meteor.com address using `meteor deploy`

When running for the first time, two users will be created with the username/passwords:

**admin/admin**, **user1/user1**

You may use these accounts to test.

Stub files exist in client/room/ for the chat room template, route, controller, and styling.  

You are welcome to change any files you wish.
